      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p className="text-center">Known for being able to bring ideas together to build out the user interface of an application. With every project, my aim is to give users a great experience from the user interface to the backend - ensuring everything works as intended.</p>
      <p className="text-center">I was drawn to the technology field at an early age. I find it incredible that with programming knowledge, you can develop applications for anything you can think of. Building applications present a good challenge to work at and accomplish. I want to use development to help people, by creating solutions to business problems that exceed their expectations.</p>
